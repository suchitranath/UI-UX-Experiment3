# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Problem Statement:

1)Compare and analyze the UX of 2–3 competing apps/websites.

2)Develop and incorporate required changes in the analysed apps/websites.

## Output:

Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App
A heuristic evaluation was conducted on two competing mobile applications in the online food delivery domain: Swiggy and Zomato. These apps were chosen due to their large user base and comparable functionalities. The evaluation was carried out using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics, focusing on factors like visibility of system status, match between system and real world, user control and freedom, consistency, error prevention, and aesthetic design. Both apps offered a streamlined interface; however, differences were noted in navigation ease, clarity of filters, and the visual hierarchy used in showcasing food options and discounts.

1)Comparison and Analysis of User Experience

While Zomato presented a visually appealing interface with rich media content, it sometimes overwhelmed users with excessive promotional banners, leading to cognitive overload. Swiggy, on the other hand, maintained a cleaner interface with easier-to-use filters and quicker access to previous orders. In terms of UX flow, Swiggy's checkout process was more intuitive, whereas Zomato provided more detailed restaurant information, aiding decision-making. From a usability standpoint, Swiggy performed better on the heuristic of flexibility and efficiency of use, especially for repeat users.


2)Development and Incorporation of Required Changes

Based on the heuristic evaluation, several UX design improvements were proposed. For Zomato, the homepage was redesigned to reduce visual clutter and prioritize user-relevant content like top picks and current offers, using collapsible sections. For Swiggy, the modification included improving the discoverability of the customer support chat feature and adding better visual cues for active filters. These changes aimed to enhance navigation clarity, minimize user frustration, and improve task completion time.

3)Evaluation of Design Changes Through A/B Testing

To measure the impact of the proposed changes, A/B testing was conducted over a two-week period. Group A interacted with the original interface (control group), while Group B used the modified version (test group). Metrics such as average session duration, click-through rate (CTR) on restaurant listings, conversion rate (order completion), and bounce rate were analyzed. In Zomato's case, Group B showed a 15% reduction in bounce rate and a 12% increase in conversion rates, indicating that reducing visual noise improved user focus and engagement. For Swiggy, the test group experienced a 20% increase in customer support interactions and an 8% faster checkout time, affirming the improved usability of navigation and task flow. These findings validate that thoughtful heuristic-based design changes can significantly enhance the user experience and influence user behavior positively.
